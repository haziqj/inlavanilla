# inlavanilla 0.1.0

* Initial version. `inla_vanilla()` approximates the posterior of any
  log-posterior written on an unconstrained scale with the INLAvaan pipeline:
  a Laplace approximation, a VB mean correction (by a deterministic degree-5
  cubature rule), skew-normal marginals with the volume correction, and the
  log marginal likelihood. `sampling()` gives Gaussian-copula draws of the
  parameters or of any function of them. `print()`, `summary()` and `plot()`
  methods report the fit and its diagnostics.
* `loo()` and `waic()` estimate predictive accuracy from the fit and a
  pointwise log-likelihood `loglik(theta, ...)`, by the deterministic
  second-order Taylor approximation of Alhyari et al. (2026): no refits and no
  draws. The results work with `loo::loo_compare()`. A new vignette,
  "Model comparison with LOO and WAIC", shows how.
* The VB correction (`vb`) and the skew-normal marginals (`marginals =
  "skewnormal"` or `"gaussian"`) can each be switched off, down to the
  Laplace approximation alone.
* Two website articles, "Speeding up with Rcpp" and "Using TMB", fit a
  structural equation model with 39 parameters from a log-posterior written
  in R, in C++ with an analytic gradient, and as a TMB template.
