# inlavanilla (development version)

* Initial version. `inla_vanilla()` approximates the posterior of any
  log-posterior written on an unconstrained scale with the INLAvaan pipeline:
  a Laplace approximation, a VB mean correction (by a deterministic degree-5
  cubature rule), skew-normal marginals with the volume correction, and the
  log marginal likelihood. `sampling()` gives Gaussian-copula draws of the
  parameters or of any function of them. `print()`, `summary()` and `plot()`
  methods report the fit and its diagnostics.
