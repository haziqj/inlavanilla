# Stage 1b: the variational Bayes mean correction. The Laplace Gaussian is
# recentred at mode + shift, keeping its covariance, where the shift maximises
# the Gaussian expectation of the log-posterior. At the optimum the expected
# gradient vanishes, E[grad log pi(mode + shift + z)] = 0 for z ~ N(0, Sigma).
#
# There are two ways to solve it. vb = "full" iterates to the solution: a
# fixed-point iteration with Anderson(1) acceleration and an nlminb() fallback,
# on a degree-5 cubature rule built on a regular simplex (vb_nodes()). With a
# gradient it uses the expected gradient over the nodes. Without one it uses
# Stein's identity on the same nodes, from log-posterior values alone.
#
# vb = "onestep", the default, takes the first step of that iteration and
# stops. The fixed-point map is nearly flat (its slope is O(1/n)), so the first
# step holds most of the movement, and exact VB is itself only O(n^-3/2)
# posterior SDs from the posterior mean. With a gradient the step uses 2m + 1
# nodes on the principal axes (axis_nodes()), about one numerical Hessian.
# Without one it is one Stein pass on vb_nodes(), since Stein's identity needs
# that rule's degree. See lab/ideas/2026-11-one-step-vb.

# Node set for the Gaussian expectation: a degree-5 rule built on a regular
# simplex, on the principal axes of Sigma. In whitened coordinates its nodes
# are the centre and
#   +/- r a_k    at the m + 1 vertices a_k of a regular simplex (unit
#                vectors with a_k' a_l = -1/m),
#   +/- s b_kl   along the m (m + 1) / 2 edge directions
#                b_kl = (a_k + a_l) / |a_k + a_l|,
# (m + 1)(m + 2) nodes besides the centre, about half the 2m^2 of the fully
# symmetric degree-5 rule on the principal axes, which the package used
# before. The node set is invariant under the symmetries of the simplex and
# under -I, so by Sobolev's theorem the rule integrates every polynomial of
# degree five or less exactly once it integrates the invariant ones: 1,
# |z|^2, |z|^4 and p4(z) = sum_k (a_k' z)^4, whose Gaussian moments are 1, m,
# m(m + 2) and 3(m + 1). Given the radii, these fix the total weight of each
# shell. While the vertex shell's weight is not negative (m <= 7) both shells
# sit on the sphere of radius sqrt(m + 2), and every weight is positive.
# Beyond that the vertex weights are negative whatever the radii; r^2 = 3
# then keeps them small, and s^2 falls from 8.4 (m = 8) towards 6. At m = 7
# the vertex weight is exactly zero and those nodes are dropped. No node is
# more than 3 posterior SDs from the centre. Some weights are negative, so
# sums over the nodes are taken as differences, which keeps large terms from
# cancelling.
#
# For m <= 3 some directions coincide (a_2 = -a_1 at m = 1, a_k + a_l = -a_j
# at m = 2, a_1 + a_2 = -(a_3 + a_4) at m = 3), and each node is kept once.
# This gives the classical rules: the three-point Gauss-Hermite rule (m = 1),
# Radon's seven-point rule on a hexagon (m = 2), and the corners of a cube
# with the vertices of an octahedron (m = 3).
#
# The nodes come in antipodal pairs: the centre, then one node of each pair,
# then their negatives in the same order. The principal axes take a fixed
# sign (each with its largest entry positive), because the simplex is not
# symmetric under the sign of a single axis, so the rule must not depend on
# the signs that eigen() happens to return.
