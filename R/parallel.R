# Parallel evaluation through the future package, which is optional. There are
# two switches: the `cores` argument of inla_vanilla(), which sets up workers
# for one fit and restores the user's plan afterwards, and the user's own
# future::plan(), which applies when `cores` is NULL. With neither, nothing here
# runs and the fit is a plain loop. Whatever the switch, a fit gives the numbers
# of a serial fit. The work divides into items that do not depend on each other,
# and anything that goes wrong on a worker is done again in the parent, so
# parallelism only ever saves time.
#
# The items are spread over the jobs at the start, at most one job per worker,
# and each job runs to its end. A job signals the parent after each item, so
# the parent's progress line moves one item at a time, as in a serial fit. See
# lab/DESIGN.md.

# Below this estimate of the serial time, in seconds, the work is not worth
# sending to workers: a job costs tens of milliseconds at least, and on the
# fits tried the gain was a few hundred milliseconds at best.
